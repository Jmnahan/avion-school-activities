In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset</p>

                  <p class="timeline-para">Turing's first true home was at King's College, Cambridge University. Turing studied mathematics with increasing distinction and was elected a Fellow of the college in 1935. The paper “On Computable Numbers…” (Turing 1936–7) was his first and perhaps greatest triumph. It gave a definition of computation and an absolute limitation on what computation could achieve. </p>

      <h4 class="article-title">Enigma and the Bombe</h4>
        <p class="article-paras">The main focus of Turing’s work at Bletchley was in cracking the ‘Enigma’ code. The Enigma was a type of enciphering machine used by the German armed forces to send messages securely. Although Polish mathematicians had worked out how to read Enigma messages and had shared this information with the British, the Germans increased its security at the outbreak of war by changing the cipher system daily. This made the task of understanding the code even more difficult.</p>
        <p class="article-paras">Turing played a key role in this, inventing – along with fellow code-breaker Gordon Welchman – a machine known as the Bombe. This device helped to significantly reduce the work of the code-breakers. From mid-1940, German Air Force signals were being read at Bletchley and the intelligence gained from them was helping the war effort.</p>
        <p class="article-paras">Turing also worked to decrypt the more complex German naval communications that had defeated many others at Bletchley. With the help of captured Enigma material, and Turing’s work in developing a technique he called 'Banburismus', the naval Enigma messages were able to be read from 1941.</p>

        <h4 class="article-title">Legacy</h4>
          <p class="article-paras">It is an achievement in life to have been credited with changing the course of history once in a lifetime, but to have done it twice in a short lifetime is truly exceptional. Turing's work not only had significant impact on the defeat of Nazism through his Enigma code-breaking, but his mathematical work is the basis of modern computing. The modern world of iPads, Facebook , mobile phones are all based on his ideas.</p>
          <p class="article-paras">His work is still the basis for much of the more fundamental research in artificial intelligence. Sixty years on from Turing famously opening his paper on Computing Machinery and Intelligence, asking if machines can think, the idea of intelligent computers seems a little less ridiculous.</p>
          <p class="article-paras">The loss due to him committing suicide using a cyanide-laced apple is perhaps a strong indicator of the price we can pay for our intolerances. His life led to many advances that have improved the lot of humanity, from modern media to healthcare. Perhaps if he had lived in a more tolerant age he would have continued to produce yet more benefits for mankind.</p>
